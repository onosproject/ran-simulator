# Simulation of E2 Nodes
RAN simulator is capable of simulating an arbitrary number of E2 nodes. The E2 nodes can be defined
statically in the simulation model ([Simulation Model](model.md)) in the RAN simulator helm chart
or can be added/removed at runtime using [RAN simulator APIs](api.md).

Each E2 node implements  an E2 agent interface. Currently, each E2 agent implements E2AP procedures including *Subscription*, *Subscription Delete*,
and *Control* procedures.
