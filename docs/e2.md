# Simulation of E2 Nodes
RAN simulator is capable of simulating an arbitrary number of E2 nodes. The E2 nodes can be defined statically in the simulation model ([Simulation Model](model.md)) from the RAN simulator helm chart or can be added/removed at runtime using [RAN simulator APIs](api.md).

Each E2 node implements an E2 agent interface. Currently, each E2 agent implements E2AP procedures including *Subscription*, *Subscription Delete*, *Connection Update*, and *Configuration Update*.
and *Control* procedures. 

# Supported Service Models
The supported service models are listed as follows:
