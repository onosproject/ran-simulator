# Ran Simulator

The Ran Simulator is part of ÂµONOS and is meant to work alongside `onos-ric` and
`sd-ran-gui`.

The simulator mimics a collection of Cell Towers and a set of UE's moving along
routes between different locations.

The application is very tunable through startup parameters, and can be run:
 
* as a standalone application in docker
* deployed in a **Kubernetes** cluster

## Google Maps API Key
The RAN Simulator can connect to Google's [Directions API] with a Google API Key.
Google charges $5.00 per 1000 requests to the [Directions API], and so we do not put
our API key up in the public domain. Without the API key directions will be created
randomly between 2 locations (usually in the form of a zig-zag line).

The SD RAN GUI also (separately) accesses Google [Maps API] and incurs an additional
cost of $7.00 per 1000 requests.

## Startup parameters
Supplying `ran-simulator` with a bogus parameter gets it to show the start parameters
and their defaults
```bash
docker run -it onosproject/ran-simulator:latest -test
...

```

See [deployment.md](deployment.md) for how to change these for a Kubernetes deployment.

## Browser access
When deployed with the **sd-ran-gui** application, the simulation can be accessed
from a browser.
